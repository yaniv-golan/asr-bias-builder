# Basic Usage Example

```bash
asr-bias-builder pipeline examples/basic/sample_deck.pdf
```

Outputs referenced in `examples/basic/expected_output/` were generated from the same sample deck using the default config. Compare the files to validate your environment (artifacts will be written to `./asr-bias-output/sample_deck/` unless you override `--output-dir`).
