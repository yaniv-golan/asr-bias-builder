# Example Configurations

- `basic.yml` – conservative prompt/phrase caps for small decks.
- `advanced.yml` – enables POS filtering, alias inclusion, and custom boosts.
- `deck_specific.yml` – shows how to pin deny lists per sanitized deck ID.

Copy one of these files next to your deck and pass it via `--config` or `BIAS_CONFIG_FILE`.
